# pfSense RDS Multigateway Config
Setting up a metro stretched pfsense for rds or a website

Fill the CSV with desired configuration and the powershell script will change the config file for you.

When you are setting up the pfsense firewall choose interfaces in order > WAN, LAN, OPT1

If you know how I can do this directly on firewall with ssh instead of using backup and restore config file please let me know.
